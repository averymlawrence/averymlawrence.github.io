(put head in 5-gallon bucket with hole in it that exposes mouth. push off left foot to elevate legs, torso, etc above head.)

"I’d like to lead us in a breathing exercise.

Inhale. (close eyes) The articulation of the body starts...where? In the mind? What? (open eyes) What if I shiver? What if I tremble? What if I’m in a theater watching the projected light and the bad person does the bad thing, surprisingly, AND I jump? Who’s in control of that motion? Who decides? Is it something bigger bigger bigger than us? Something inconceivably small? Do I decide? Do you? Do we? Exhale. Thanks. Maybe we INHALE and hold it and hold it and hoooooooold it and poof. Exhale. We let it out and our collective relief stops the making of a promising but ultimately disappointing Hollywood reboot or remake or prequel or sequel or squeakquel. And we try again. And we inhale. Inhale. Inhale. And hoooooold it and poof. Exhale. And does our new relief stop a war or a skirmish or, at least, at the very least a Kardashian? But don’t think too hard! We can’t think too hard or we’ll lose it. So, inhale with the air. And let it sit. Feeeeeeel it occupy your fleshy meat palace. Feeeeeeel it inside yourself from outside yourself. Adjacent to yourself. And feel it satisfy you and you and you and you and me and us and them and future them and past them and dead them. And we remember that we’re holding it and then poof we exhale, COLLECTIVELY, and poof! We knock over a pile of cards and a magician dies and sausage is made and a party ends disappointingly. And how do you feel now? HUH? Now that you’ve killed a magician? 

Ugh. Is it all a deception?

So INHALE and hold in the air cuz, in the end, it is all WE have. Well, I guess WE also have water, but maybe not for long. And WE have oil we slurp and spit. And WE have vast corporations that sponsor art events in which free labor is celebrated, wristbands distributed, white wine sipped. But I’m not complaining. Heck. Look at us in here now. We are lucky. We are sociality. WE have each other, if only for a little bit. Now focus on your breath, THE BREATH, cuz without it you’re a vast blob of directionless space debris pushing further and further away from some center waiting for that spreading to fatigue and the reverse BIG BANG to sluuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuurp you and you and you and me and us and them and future them and past them and dead them back together again until we are just THE one thing that every other piece of matter is too. 

And exhale. Very good. And inhale and remember that Bill Murray as the character Phil Connors lives 34 years worth of February 2nds in the 1993 Hollywood rom/com blockbuster Groundhog Day. I recently rewatched it. We’re still breathing. You’re still breathing. Exhale. Inhale. And in the movie, Bill plays Phil (not the groundhog Punxsatawney Phil) but Phil the weatherman who is grumpy and dissatisfied and mean. But in the end, he’s happy cuz he’s in bed with a woman on February 3 and Sonny and Cher’s “I Got You Babe” is NOT playing on the radio cuz it plays on the radio every Febraruy 2nd but NOT every February 3rd. Exhale. Inhale. So he’s happy. But remember, it took him 34 years. And in the middle there is the suicide montage. 
Exhale. Inhale. Bill Murray as Phil Connors places his toaster in his bath, the lights flicker. Dead. He drives over the cliff with the stolen groundhog, the stolen pickup. Dead. He steps in front of the big box truck. Dead. And he jumps from the tower. He’s dead dead dead dead dead over and over again. Exhale. Inhale. It’s like 9/11 all over again on your TV on September 11 and then again on September 11 on September 12 and then again on September 11 on September 13 and you get what I’m saying. In his book Extremely Loud and Incredibly close Jonathan Safran Foer includes a sequence of images that suggest a man is floating back up instead of jumping down from one of the burning floors above the crash site on one of the towers...or maybe above that. Exhale. Inhale. Then there’s Yves Klein leaping into the void - an artist’s second-story dismount, arms spread wide - super Instagram-friendly. But that was fake. But who cares? And then there’s Bill Murray - but not Bill Murray because he was playing the character Phil Connors - but not Bill Murray as Phil Connors cuz that was definitely, obviously a stuntman - arms wide, jumping from who knows where down to who knows where. But that was fake. But who cares? Then there’s the net to catch the iPhone builders at Foxconn. But there’s no net or wall at the Golden Gate Bridge cuz that’s proven prohibitively expensive. But there are hotlines. And text messages. And conversations. And hugs and kisses. And you and you and you and me and us and them and future them and past them and dead them. And you get it. Exhale. Inhale.

And remember to breathe. And remember to never forget. And remember we may all be wrought FROM and we may all end up AS that same original matter BUT that doesn’t make us the same BUT it may just establish that gleam of sameness that makes you me and me you in all sorts of unexpected, wonderous ways. And remember that you could wake up and it’s February 2nd and Sonny and Cher are singing “I Got You, Babe” on the radio and Bill Murray pulls back the covers and washes his face again and again and again and again and again and again and again. But remember tomorrow could always be February 3. Exhale."

(use looping pedal to create beat. sing Sonny and Cher's "I Got You, Babe". say "thank you". drop feet, torso, etc down. remove head from bucket. awkwardly acknowledge crowd/absence of crowd.)
