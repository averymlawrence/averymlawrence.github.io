Ray worships at St. Roch Community Church and supports the New Orleans school choice system. While working late one evening around 7:30 PM, July 10, 2013, Ray stumbled upon a report that that the Sixers traded Jrue Holiday for #6 2013 draft pick Nerlens Noel and a Pelicans future 1st round pick. At that moment Ray knew that things would never be the same, that a man with two parts patience and one part courage, Sam Hinkie would do everything he could to build a championship contender. Ray loves the Sixers and trusts the process.
